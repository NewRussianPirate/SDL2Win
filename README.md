SDL2Win is a simple window creation template for the [sdl2-cs wrap](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS) with c# event system. There is only handle for SDL_WINDOWEVENT and some window-related functions like Get/SetSize(), Get/SetWindowOpacity(), etc. Changing win icon and cursor requires native SDL_Image lib.
